# CS-303-2

This project implements two data structures in C++, a singly linked list and a stack using vectors. 
The purpose of this project is to show basic data structue implementation and provide an example of stack and linked list usage in C++.

Stack Operations
1. Create a stack
2. Push integers onto the stack
3. Pop an element from the stack
4. Display the top element of the stack
5. Calculate the average of the stack elements

Singly Linked List Operations
1. Add elements to the front and back of the list
2. Insert an element at a specfic index
3. Remove an element from the list
4. Output the front and back of the list
5. Output the size of the list
